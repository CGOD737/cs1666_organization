# Physics Advanced Topic Presentations

## Presentation I (Oct. 19):
Physics

Physics exists in games too!
	Try to simulate given hardware/real-time constraints

Games with physics!
	Minecraft
	Super Meat Boy
	Goat Simulator

What is physics?
	Vectors(Acceleration, velocity, displacement relationship)
	Forces/Mass
	Normal Force
	Friction
	Collisions(Momentum)
	
Identifying physics within games
	Minecraft
	Super Meat Boy
	Goat Simulator

Applying Physics to our game
	Describing our game, emphasizing physics

	


## Presentation II (Nov. 4):

* Approximation
  * Some things are far too complex to simulate in real time
    * Destruction
    * Realistic - Blender Simulation
    * Game
      * Minecraft - tnt
      * Noita
  * Fluid Dynamics
    * Realistic - Another Blender Simulation
    * Game
      * Not generally close to realistic looking
      * Minecraft - water
      * GTA V - waves
      * Mario - water level
  * Some things don't have to be simulated at all times
    * Gravity when standing still

* Friction and Drag
  * On ground
  * In Water
  * In air

* Air Control
  * Different systems
    * Realistic - No air control
      * 2D
        * Mario
        * Asteroid
        * Metroid
      * 3D
        * Borderlands
        * TF2
        * Minecraft
